                    <h3>Steps:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Pat 1 1/2 pounds of pork ribs dry with paper towels. Heat 2 tablespoons neutral oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Making sure not to overcrowd the pot and, working in batches, sear until browned all over, about 10 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate.</li>
                        <li>Add 8 ounces chopped tomatoes, 1 diced large yellow onion, and 3 crushed garlic cloves to the pot. Sauté until the tomatoes are softened, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Return the short ribs back to the pat. Stir in 5 cups water, 1 whole long green chili, 2 tablespoons tamarind soup base, 2 tablespoons fish sauce, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Bring to a boil. Cover and boil for 20 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Stir in 1 pound cut radish, 1 pound cut eggplant, and 4 ounces okra, making sure the vegetables are submerged. Reduced the heat as needed to maintain simmer. Cover and simmer until the radish is fork-tender, about 3 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Stir in 8 ounces cut long beans, making sure they are submerged. Cook uncovered until the long beans are tender, about 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat off. Stir in 3 ounces cut water spinach. Cover and let sit until the water spinach wilts, about 2 minutes. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed.</li>
                        <li>Serve with rice.</li>
