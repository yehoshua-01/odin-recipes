# Odin Recipes
Project Title: Odin Recipes
Author: Joshua Felicilda
Date: December 6, 2025

This project focuses on food recipes. The main objective is to apply and demonstrate my learnings from The Odin Project, particularly on Foundations Course under HTML foundations.

In conclusion of this project, I learned how to make HTML boilerplate and work with contents such as texts, paragraphs, lists, links, and images, and I also applied HTML elements, tags, and attributes, and Git basic commands for saving this project.
