Project Title: Odin Recipes

This project focuses on food recipes. The main objective is to apply and demonstrate my learnings from The Odin Project HTML and CSS lesson.

In conclusion of this project, I learned how to make HTML boilerplate and work with contents such as texts, paragraphs, lists, links, images, elements, tags, and attributes. I learned how to put style on HTML using CSS applying box models, properties, selectors, and layouts. I also learned how to use Git and its basic commands for managing my files and repositories.
